# 👋 Welcome to Our Job Application Repo

Welcome to **Our dev-first job application experience**.

We believe that applying for a job shouldn't feel like submitting a tax return.

This repo lets you apply for one of our open developer roles by doing what you already do best: **creating a pull request**.
