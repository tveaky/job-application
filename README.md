Welcome to **Scania IT's dev-first job application experience**.

We believe that applying for a job shouldn't feel like submitting a tax return.

This repo lets you apply for one of our open developer roles by doing what you already do best: **creating a pull request**.

## 🤖 What to Expect

- When you open a PR, our friendly (and slightly snarky) HRBot will greet you.
- A human will review your application.
- If we think it’s a fit, we’ll label your PR with `ready-for-form` and invite you to fill out a short official form (yes, HR made us).
- You’ll never be ghosted—we'll respond, even if it's a no.

The more “you” your PR feels, the better.
